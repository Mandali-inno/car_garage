# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that uses Firebase for authentication and other backend services. The app is currently under development and the main goal is to create a robust and scalable application with a clean architecture.

## Features

*   **Firebase Integration:** The app is connected to a Firebase project.
*   **Google Sign-In:** The app uses Google Sign-In for user authentication.

## Current Status

The application is now building and running on the emulator. The Google Sign-In is not yet functional and requires the addition of a SHA-1 fingerprint to the Firebase project. The necessary instructions have been provided in the `docs/login_setup_instructions.md` file.

## Development Log

*   **Initial Setup:** The project was created and Firebase was integrated.
*   **Google Sign-In Implementation:** The `google_sign_in` package was added to the project, but it caused persistent build errors.
*   **Troubleshooting:** The following steps were taken to resolve the build issues:
    *   `flutter clean`
    *   `flutter pub get`
    *   Deleted `pubspec.lock` and re-ran `flutter pub get`
    *   Reinstalled the `google_sign_in` package
    *   Downgraded the `google_sign_in` package to `6.2.1`
*   **Resolution:** The build errors were resolved by downgrading the `google_sign_in` package.
*   **Next Steps:** The next step is to add the SHA-1 fingerprint to the Firebase project to enable Google Sign-In.
